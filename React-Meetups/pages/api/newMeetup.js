  collections full of documents
  document
    a single entry in a collection

- MongoDB is a NoSQL-database
- it is not relational database
- it is a document-based database

- collections would be kind of your table in SQL-database
- document would be your entries in those tables

-> you have collections which hold multiple documents and a single meetup would be a single document
