/* NextJS Rendering
- we might have SEO Problems if we use useEffect() to fetch-data
* Does not wait for the data to be fetched to then return the fully pre-rendered page, but it returns the result of the first component rendered cycle and that might be a pretty empty page

BUT Nextjs has 2 solution for pre-rendering the content-data
  - Static Site Generation (SSG):
    a page component is pre-rendered when you build your application, when you build the Next project, When You build it for the production(npm run build)

  - Server-side Rendering (SSR)
*/

/* getStaticProps()
?- Nextjs first of all, call getStaticProps() before it calls the component-function

- its job is to prepare the props for this page
- and this props could then contain the data this page needs

?- getStaticProps() is allowed to be "asynchronous"
- you can return a promise there
- nextjs will wait for this promise to resolve
- it waits until your data is loaded
- then you return the props for this component-fn

- inside this getStaticProps() you could access a file system or securely connect to a database
* because any code you write in here will never end up on the client-side and it will never execute on the client-side, simply because this code is executed during the "build-process"
*/

/* revalidate
- this page will not just build during the build process, but it also be generated every couple of seconds on the server, at least if there are requests
*/

/* getServerSideProps()

---> run always on the server after deployment | use it: if you need to access to request-obj and authentication & if you have multiple-data that changes every seconds

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  ---> access to request-obj & response-obj
  const req = context.req;
  const res = context.res;

  ---> fetch data from an API

  return {
    props: {
      meetups: DUMMY_MEETUPS,
    },

    ---> this fn does not need "revalidate"
  };
